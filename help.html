	<h3>Working With</h3>

		<li>Click the Start button to start working on a task.</li>
		<li>The active task will have a red border and its button will change to a Pause button.</li>

	</ul>

		<li>Click on the Completed Tasks button on the button of the screen to show a list of you 10 most recently completed tasks. Each time you click the Completed Tasks button you will cycle through 10 tasks at a time.</li>
		<li>Once you find the task you wish to un-complete, click the button with the unlock icon next to the task name and it will be added back into your tasklist.</li>
		<li>Click the Hide Completes button to hide your completed tasks.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Salesforce Sync</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A direct linkage is not currently implemented, so you will need to manually input your times into salesforce.</li>
		<li>Your time spent on tasks will be displayed in a table on the left side of the page. This time is displayed in an hourly value that is directly usable by Salesforce.</li>
		<li>You will need to update Salesforce daily as the time spent on tasks is cumulative until reset with the reset button.</li>
		<li>After importing your time into Salesforce, click Open Menu and Reset the daily totals to erase the stored time for that day.</li>
	</ul>	
	<h3>Manager View</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>In this view you can see both Technical Guru's tasklists side-by-side.</li>
		<li>You can add tasks to either list, reorder lists, and drag tasks between lists.</li>
		<li>If you leave the Manager View open too long, it may become out of sync with the current tasks. To update the tasks, click on Open Menu and Refresh each user's list.</li>
